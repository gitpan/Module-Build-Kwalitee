0.24
  * fix M::B::K::Stub to hide the stubbed version from CPAN indexer

0.22
  * Make ourselves installable.
    Thanks to Jos Boumans for pointing out the problem.
  * Use M::B::K to install M::B::K.

0.21
  * Actually ship the Makefile.PL. I suck.

0.20
  * Revert change to not generate Makefile.PL - the version
    of CPAN.pm released with Perl 5.8 fails to install us :(

0.19
  * Don't generate a Makefile.PL - we're only useable with 
    Module::Build
  * speed up the compile test of modules by forking more 
    than one process at a time
  * make compile test of scripts be more quiet
  * compile testing of scripts now works correctly if there is no
    'blib' or 'lib' directory
  * do pod coverage tests in repeatable order
  * do pod syntax tests even if we can't do pod coverage tests
    and vice versa

0.18
  * make use of Module::Build magic to install .t files
  * also test-compile perl scripts in bin/
  * always report 'naked' subroutines
  * skip 'total_coverage' test if there are no modules with pod

0.17
  * removed traces of utility module that turned out to be 
    the wrong solution

0.16
  * merged 'use strict' and 'use warnings' tests
  * make own test apply to ourselves better

0.15
  * symlink shipped tests to t/ so they are run for us too
  * use 'traditional' style of generating Makefile.PL

0.14
  * Improve description a bit

0.13
  * The stub M::B::K that ships with distributions now merely
    recommend some modules; if they are missing, some tests are
    skipped.  they do not exist. For module authors, however,
    these modules are all mandatory (so all tests will run).

  * for .pod files, do syntax checking but skip coverage checks

0.12 
  * Added Changes file

0.11
  * Minor pod fixes

0.10
  * Initial release to CPAN
